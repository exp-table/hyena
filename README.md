# Hyena â€¢ [![tests](https://github.com/exp-table/hyena/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?label=tests)](https://github.com/exp-table/hyena/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/refcell/femplate?label=license) ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.17-lightgrey)

A data packing library.

## What is Hyena?

Hyena is a library that is an alternative to `abi.encode` and `abi.encodePacked` that can result in smaller `bytes`.


It **WON'T** beat `abi.encode` or `abi.encodePacked` in terms of gas consumption but will in the size of the output. A reduction of up to 50% can be obtained.

It serves as educational material.

**Warning**

It should be noted that unpacking the payload produces an array whose elements order is in reverse w.r.t the elements that were added.

## Installation

To install with [**Foundry**](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry):

```sh
forge install exp-table/hyena
```

## Usage

```js
bytes memory payload = Hyena.cook();
payload = Hyena.crush(crystal, uint(100));
payload = Hyena.crush(crystal, uint(2**256 - 1));
uint256[] memory outputs = Hyena.digest(crystal);
```
